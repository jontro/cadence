## What
Cadence CLI is a command-line tool to perform various tasks on a Cadence server.
It can perform domain operations such as register, update, and describe as well as workflow operations like
start workflow, show workflow history, and signal workflow.

## How
- Run `make bins`
- You should see an executable `cadence`
- (Optional) You could also use docker image `ubercadence/cli`, by replacing all the following `./cadence ...` with `docker run --rm ubercadence/cli:master --address <HOST_DNS>:7933 ...` . For old versions of docker, HOST_DNS is just 127.0.0.1; for 18.03 onwards, you may have to use host.docker.internal. For more info check https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds  

## Quick Start
Run `./cadence` for help on top level commands and global options   
Run `./cadence domain` for help on domain operations  
Run `./cadence workflow` for help on workflow operations  
Run `./cadence tasklist` for help on tasklist operations  
(`./cadence help`, `./cadence help [domain|workflow]` will also print help messages)

**Note:** make sure you have cadence server running before using CLI 

### Domain operation examples 
- Register a new domain named "samples-domain":  
```
./cadence --domain samples-domain domain register 
# OR using short alias  
./cadence --do samples-domain domain re
```   
- View "samples-domain" details:   
```
./cadence --domain samples-domain domain describe  
```

**Tip:**  
To avoid repeatedly including the global option **--domain**, 
export domain-name to the CADENCE_CLI_DOMAIN environment variable.
```
export CADENCE_CLI_DOMAIN=samples-domain
```
Then commands can omit the **--domain** flag:
```
./cadence domain desc
```

### Workflow operation examples
(The following examples assume the CADENCE_CLI_DOMAIN environment variable is set using the tip above)

#### Run workflow: Start a workflow and see it's progress. This command doesn't finish until workflow completes.
```
./cadence workflow run --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"'

# view help messages for workflow run
./cadence workflow run -h
``` 
Brief explanation:  
To run a workflow, user must specify 
1. Tasklist name (--tl), 
2. Workflow type (--wt), 
3. Execution start to close timeout in seconds (--et), 

Example uses [this cadence-samples workflow](https://github.com/samarabbas/cadence-samples/blob/master/cmd/samples/recipes/helloworld/helloworld_workflow.go) 
and takes a string as input with the `-i '"cadence"'` parameter. Single quotes (`''`) are used to wrap input as json. 

**Note:** you need to start the worker so that workflow can make progress.  
(Run `make && ./bin/helloworld -m worker` in cadence-samples to start the worker)

#### Show running workers of a tasklist
```
./cadence tasklist desc --tl helloWorldGroup
```

#### Start workflow
```
./cadence workflow start --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"'

# view help messages for workflow start
./cadence workflow start -h

# for workflow with multiple input, separate each json with space/newline like
./cadence workflow start --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.WorkflowWith3Args --et 60 -i '"your_input_string" 123 {"Name":"my-string", "Age":12345}'
```
The workflow `start` command is similar to the `run` command, but immediately returns the workflow_id and 
run_id after starting the workflow. Use the `show` command to view the workflow's history/progress.  

**Re-use the same workflow id when starting/running workflow**

Use option `--workflowidreusepolicy` or `--wrp` to configure the workflow id re-use policy.  
**Option 0 AllowDuplicateFailedOnly:** Allow starting a workflow execution using the same workflow ID when a workflow with the same workflow ID is not already running and the last execution close state is one of *[terminated, cancelled, timedout, failed]*.  
**Option 1 AllowDuplicate:** Allow starting a workflow execution using the same workflow ID when a workflow with the same workflow ID is not already running.  
**Option 2 RejectDuplicate:** Do not allow starting a workflow execution using the same workflow ID as a previous workflow.  
```
# use AllowDuplicateFailedOnly option to start a workflow
./cadence workflow start --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"' --wid "<duplicated workflow id>" --wrp 0

# use AllowDuplicate option to run a workflow
./cadence workflow run --tl helloWorldGroup --wt main.Workflow --et 60 -i '"cadence"' --wid "<duplicated workflow id>" --wrp 1
```

#### Show workflow history
```
./cadence workflow show -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 -r 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0
# a shortcut of this is (without -w -r flag)
./cadence workflow showid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0

# if run_id is not provided, it will show the latest run history of that workflow_id
./cadence workflow show -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
# a shortcut of this is
./cadence workflow showid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
```

#### Show workflow execution info
```
./cadence workflow describe -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 -r 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0
# a shortcut of this is (without -w -r flag)
./cadence workflow describeid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717 866ae14c-88cf-4f1e-980f-571e031d71b0

# if run_id is not provided, it will show the latest workflow execution of that workflow_id
./cadence workflow describe -w 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
# a shortcut of this is
./cadence workflow describeid 3ea6b242-b23c-4279-bb13-f215661b4717
```

#### List closed or open workflow executions
```
./cadence workflow list

# default will only show one page, to view more items, use --more flag
./cadence workflow list -m
```

#### Query workflow execution
```
# use custom query type
./cadence workflow query -w <wid> -r <rid> --qt <query-type>

# use build-in query type "__stack_trace" which is supported by cadence client library
./cadence workflow query -w <wid> -r <rid> --qt __stack_trace
# a shortcut to query using __stack_trace is (without --qt flag)
./cadence workflow stack -w <wid> -r <rid> 
```

#### Signal, cancel, terminate workflow
```
# signal
./cadence workflow signal -w <wid> -r <rid> -n <signal-name> -i '"signal-value"'

# cancel
./cadence workflow cancel -w <wid> -r <rid>

# terminate
./cadence workflow terminate -w <wid> -r <rid> --reason 
```
Terminating a running workflow execution will record a WorkflowExecutionTerminated event as the closing event in the history. No more decision tasks will be scheduled for a terminated workflow execution.  
Canceling a running workflow execution will record a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in the history, and a new decision task will be scheduled. The workflow has a chance to do some clean up work after cancellation.

#### Restart, reset workflow
The Reset command allows resetting a workflow to a particular point and continue running from there.
There are a lot of use cases:
- Rerun a failed workflow from the beginning with the same start parameters.
- Rerun a failed workflow from the failing point without losing the achieved progress(history).
- After deploying new code, reset an open workflow to let the workflow run to different flows.

You can reset to some predefined event types:
```
./cadence workflow reset -w <wid> -r <rid> --reset_type <reset_type> --reason "some_reason"
```

- FirstDecisionCompleted: reset to the beginning of the history.
- LastDecisionCompleted: reset to the end of the history.
- LastContinuedAsNew: reset to the end of the history for the previous run.

If you are familiar with the Cadence history event, You can also reset to any decision finish event by using:
```
./cadence workflow reset -w <wid> -r <rid> --event_id <decision_finish_event_id> --reason "some_reason"
```
Some things to note:
- When reset, a new run will be kicked off with the same workflowID. But if there is a running execution for the workflow(workflowID), the current run will be terminated.
- decision_finish_event_id is the ID of events of the type: DecisionTaskComplete/DecisionTaskFailed/DecisionTaskTimeout.
- To restart a workflow from the beginning, reset to the first decision task finish event.

To reset multiple workflows, you can use batch reset command:
```
./cadence workflow reset-batch --input_file <file_of_workflows_to_reset> --reset_type <reset_type> --reason "some_reason"
```
